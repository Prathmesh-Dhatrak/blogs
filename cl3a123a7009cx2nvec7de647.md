## How to add a countdown section with dynamic content changing from an array of objects.


## The problem
While I was working on developing [tedxvitpune.in](https://tedxvitpune.in/) 2022 website we had to create a Days Countdown section. But the problem was that the countdown design was too complicated to develop with just Font styling CSS. We had to create an array and change the day's images from the array every day manually.

So the problem statement is to make this process automatic.

## Solution 1 - Using setinterval() with useEffect in react.
So we used the setinterval() with 1-day(```1000 * 60 * 60 * 24``` Milliseconds) timmer within the useEffect and tried changing the image array elements after every day.
```
const [day, setDay] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    setInterval(() => {
      setDay(prevDay => prevDay + 1);
    }, 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  }, []);

``` 
But the problem with setinterval() is that if we don't have a backend for the website then this code will only if the Users Browser is active 24x7
So that's why this Solution is not practically possible.

## Solution 2 - Using Date() with useEffect in react.
So the next solution we tried was to get today's day and subtracting the main Event date from that.

```
 const [day, setDay] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    var today = new Date();
    var day = 21 - today.getDate();
    setDay(day);
  }, []);

``` 
And this solution worked perfectly. Because every render of the website we are getting the remaining days for the Event.
