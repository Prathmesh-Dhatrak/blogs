# Optimizing API Calls in React with Debounce

As a front-end developer, you may have encountered a situation where you need to make API calls in a React application, but you want to avoid making too many calls at once. This can happen when you have an input field that makes an API call every time the user types something. This can lead to multiple API calls being made in a short period of time, which can slow down the application and increase the load on the server.

One way to solve this problem is to use a technique called debounce. Debounce is a rate-restriction approach that allows a function or method to run just once after a predetermined period of time has passed. It is a higher-order function, i.e., a function that returns another function. It forms a closure around the function parameters.

Debounce is useful in situations where you want to make sure that a function is not called too frequently. For example, if you have an input field that makes an API call every time the user types something, you can use debounce to ensure that the API call is only made once the user has finished typing. This can help to reduce the number of API calls being made and improve the performance of your application.

There are several ways to implement debounce in a React application. One way is to use the lodash.debounce package, which is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions for common programming tasks using the functional programming paradigm. To use lodash.debounce, you can install the package via npm and then import it into your page component.

```javascript
npm install lodash.debounce
```

Then, import it into your page component:

```javascript
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';
```

You can then use it with an input element by passing a callback function and the desired delay time:

```javascript
<input
  className=""
  placeholder="Search..."
  type="text"
  onFocus={onFocusInput}
  onChange={debounce(onSearchInputChange, 200)}
  onKeyDown={onSearchSubmit}
/>
```

Another option is to create your own custom debounce function. To do this, you can define a function that takes two arguments: the function that needs to be called after a delay and the duration of the delay. The debounce function can then use setTimeout to call the specified function after the specified delay time has passed. To pass the input from the current target element to the delayed function, you can use the apply method to apply the current value and arguments to the delayed function.

Here's an example of a custom debounce function:

```javascript
const customDebounceFunction = (function, delayTimeInMilliseconds) => {
  let timer;
  return () => {
    let self = this;
    let args = arguments;
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      function.apply(self, args)
    }, delayTimeInMilliseconds)
  }
}
```

To use the custom debounce function in a React component, you can use the useCallback hook to ensure that the function reference does not change. This will prevent the component from re-rendering unnecessarily.

```javascript
const debounceValue = useCallback(customDebounceFunction((nextValue) => onSearchInputChange(nextValue), 1000), [])
```

By using debounce, you can optimize API calls and improve the performance of your React application. If you're facing a similar issue in your own projects, consider using debounce to handle multiple API calls and reduce the load on your server.

It's worth noting that debounce is just one tool that can help you optimize API calls in a React application. There are other techniques you can use as well, such as caching API results or using a package like Axios to automatically cancel overlapping requests. Experiment with different approaches and see what works best for your specific use case.

So this is how you can handle and restrict multiple API calls in React using debounce. That's it from my side, I tried sharing everything I could. I hope this was helpful!
